                    <p>Quail Hollow Club is one of the finest championship golf courses in the country. The course at Quail Hollow blends the imagination and craftsmanship of golf greats like George Cobb, Arnold Palmer, and Tom Fazio with a majestic landscape to create a golf experience that is as challenging as it is beautiful.</p>

                    <h2>GET <strong>SET</strong> FOR GREAT&nbsp;PLAY.</h2>
                    <p>The Wells Fargo Championship traditionally draws a field of some of the most dynamic names in professional golf so you will be teamed with golfers who epitomize the best of the sport.</p>
                    <h3>Quick Reminders</h3>
                    <p>Check-in will be on the lower level of The Ballantyne Hotel &amp; Lodge before the Draft Party reception. If you are unable to attend the Draft Party, you may register Monday May 11th in the Quail Grill at Quail Hollow Club.</p>

                    <p>Your Monday Pro-Am credential will be issued to you at the Draft Party Registration. Please wear your credential at all times while on tournament grounds. The credential will be valid for tournament entry the entire week and provide you access to the Clubhouse and Quail Hollow Club grounds.</p>

                    <p>The play format will be "One Best Ball Scramble" and "Best Ball Scramble" will be enforced by the tournament. Each amateur will tee off at every hole. The team selects the best shot position from the four amateur tee shots. After selecting the best tee shot position, each amateur will play the next ball from the best position until your team has finished the hole. This is done to speed up play, as length of time to play Pro-Am events is becoming a major concern with the PGA TOUR and PGA TOUR professionals. Please note that all contestants will walk â€“ golf carts are not permitted.</p>

                    <p>Insta-Plak will be taking team photos on Pro-Am day and will distribute them on the 9 green and the 18 green at the conclusion of your round.</p>
